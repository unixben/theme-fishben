## FishBen

A fish theme based on agnoster and optimised for people who use:

* Solarized
* Git
* Unicode-compatible fonts and terminals (I use iTerm2 + Knack Nerd Font)
* Fish vi-mode

For Mac users, I highly recommend iTerm 2 + Solarized Light


### Characteristics

* If the previous command failed ()
* User @ Hostname (if user is not DEFAULT_USER, which can then be set in your profile)
* Git status
* Branch () or detached head (➦)
* Current branch / SHA1 in detached head state
* Dirty working directory (±, colour change)
* Working directory
* Elevated privileges ()
* Indicate vi mode
